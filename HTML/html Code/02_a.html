<br>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by
technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</br>
<br>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the
documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and
originally included cues for its appearance.</br>

<br>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such
as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents
by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML
elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.</br>
